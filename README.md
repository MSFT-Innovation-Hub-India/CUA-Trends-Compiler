### Integration Points

- **Azure OpenAI Responses API**: Powers AI-driven browser automation and analysis
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Enables Azure Blob Storage operations
- **Playwright**: Provides robust web browser automation
- **Pinterest Website**: Target platform for fashion trends discovery

### Architecture of the Solution

The Trends Compiler Agent is a sophisticated command-line application that combines Azure OpenAI's Computer Use capabilities with browser automation to autonomously discover and analyze fashion trends. Built on the Azure OpenAI Responses API, it provides seamless integration with Computer Use models, advanced image reasoning, and Remote Model Context Protocol (MCP) for cloud storage operations.

#### üéØ Core Architecture Overview

The solution operates as a locally-hosted intelligent agent that leverages:
- **Azure OpenAI Responses API** for AI-driven decision making and content analysis
- **Computer Use (CUA) Model** for visual understanding and browser interaction planning
- **Playwright Browser Automation** for precise web navigation and interaction
- **Remote MCP Integration** for seamless Azure Blob Storage operations

#### üîÑ Workflow Process

The agent follows a sophisticated multi-stage process to compile comprehensive trend reports:

##### **1. Initial Setup & Navigation**
- **Target Loading**: Navigates to the configured Pinterest URL and waits for complete page rendering
- **Interface Recognition**: Uses Computer Use capabilities to identify and locate the search interface elements
- **Query Input**: Employs Playwright to interact with the search box and submit user queries

##### **2. Search Results Processing**
- **Results Detection**: Computer Use model analyzes the page to determine when search results are fully loaded
- **Image Identification**: Identifies and maps coordinates of all trend images displayed in search results
- **Bounding Box Analysis**: Calculates precise center coordinates for each image for automated interaction

##### **3. Content Analysis Loop**
For each identified trend image, the system:
- **üñ±Ô∏è Automated Navigation**: Playwright clicks on calculated center coordinates to access detailed views
- **üì∏ Content Capture**: Takes high-resolution screenshots of detailed trend pages
- **üß† AI Analysis**: Leverages Azure OpenAI's vision capabilities to analyze fashion elements, colors, patterns, and trends
- **üìù Content Extraction**: Extracts and processes textual descriptions and metadata
- **üîÑ Iteration**: Repeats process for all identified trend items

##### **4. Report Compilation & Storage**
- **üìä Content Consolidation**: Aggregates all analyzed content into a structured markdown report
- **‚úÖ Completion Notification**: Provides real-time progress updates and completion status
- **‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Storage**: Integrates with Azure Blob Storage via Remote MCP for report persistence
- **üìÅ Container Management**: Automatically manages storage containers and blob organization

#### üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation Details

##### **Computer Use Integration**
The system leverages Computer Use capabilities for:
- **Visual Understanding**: Analyzing webpage layouts and identifying interactive elements
- **Coordinate Mapping**: Providing precise pixel coordinates for Playwright automation
- **Content Recognition**: Understanding when pages have loaded and content is ready for interaction

##### **Playwright Automation**
Browser automation handles:
- **Precise Interactions**: Click, type, and navigation actions based on CUA coordinates
- **Page Management**: Loading states, screenshot capture, and session management
- **Headless Operation**: Runs without user interface for automated processing

##### **Remote MCP Architecture**
Storage operations are handled via:
- **Direct API Integration**: MCP calls are made directly from the Responses API
- **Turnkey Tool Support**: No relay logic required in the agent application
- **Seamless Storage**: Automatic container creation and blob management

#### üìã Important Implementation Notes

> **üéØ Pinterest Interaction Strategy**: Pinterest's search results display images with hover-based URL revelation. The solution elegantly addresses this by using Computer Use to identify image bounding boxes and calculating center coordinates for direct click interactions, eliminating the need for complex hover-based navigation.

> **üîÑ MCP Integration Advantage**: The Remote MCP integration operates directly through the Responses API's turnkey tool calling support, providing a more streamlined architecture compared to traditional function calling patterns that require application-level relay logic.

> **üß† Model Specialization**: For image reasoning and fashion trend analysis, the GPT-4o model is utilized instead of the Computer Use model. This is because the Computer Use model is specifically tailored for visual layout understanding, menu navigation, and UI interaction tasks, while GPT-4o excels at content analysis, image interpretation, and semantic understanding of fashion elements.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### Step 1: Clone and Setup Project

```powershell
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd trends-compiler-cua-mcp

# Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1  # On Windows PowerShell
# source venv/bin/activate    # On macOS/Linux

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Install Playwright Browsers

**‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Step**: This must be done before running the application.

```powershell
# Install all Playwright browsers (recommended)
playwright install

# Or install only Chromium (minimum requirement)
playwright install chromium
```

### Step 3: Azure CLI Authentication

```powershell
# Login to Azure (required for Azure OpenAI access)
az login

# Verify your subscription (optional)
az account show
```

### Step 4: Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following configuration:

```env
# ==========================================
# Azure OpenAI Configuration (REQUIRED)
# ==========================================
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-openai-resource.openai.azure.com/
MODEL_NAME=computer-use-preview
AZURE_API_VERSION=2025-03-01-preview
VISION_MODEL_NAME=gpt-4o

# ==========================================
# Application Configuration
# ==========================================
web_crawl_url=https://in.pinterest.com/ideas
max_pages_for_crawling=5

# ==========================================
# MCP Server Configuration (OPTIONAL)
# ==========================================
MCP_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

   ```

2. **Check System Resources**:
   - Close unnecessary browser windows
   - Ensure sufficient RAM (8GB+ recommended)
   - Close other heavy applications

3. **Network Optimization**:
   - Use stable internet connection
   - Consider using ethernet over Wi-Fi

## üìà Advanced Usage Tips

### Optimizing Query Results

**Best Practices for Queries**:
- ‚úÖ Be specific: "Korean street fashion spring 2024" vs. "fashion"
- ‚úÖ Include context: "sustainable office wear for women"
- ‚úÖ Use current terms: "Y2K revival trends" vs. "retro fashion"
- ‚úÖ Specify demographics: "teen summer fashion" vs. "summer fashion"


### Report Management

Reports are saved with timestamps to avoid conflicts:
- Format: `{query-slug}-{DDMMYY}.md`
- Example: `korean-street-fashion-150625.md`
